Stabilipy
=========

StabiliPy is a Python package that provides a simple interface to compute
static equilibrium polygons and robust static equilibrium polyhedrons.

This problem is a projection problem, and uses the recursive projection
method to compute those regions. You can thus use this package to compute
arbitrary convex projections by recursive projection.
