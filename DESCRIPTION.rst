This is a simple program to compute the stability polygon of a legged robot
over n contacts. It computes a set of extremum points via cone-programming
and builds an outer and inner polygon from them.

See the paper by Bretl and Lall, "Testing static equilibrium for legged robots"
(IEEE Transaction on Robotics, August 2008) for more details.
